## How Fees Impact Your Trading

Fees are an essential aspect of trading that can affect profitability. Lower fees at higher leverage points encourage strategic, high-leverage trading, but traders must also consider the associated risks.

<Accordion title="Strategic Considerations">
  While lower fees can increase profitability on successful trades, the risks of higher leverage such as closer liquidation points also increase. It's important to balance potential rewards with the risks you're comfortable taking.
