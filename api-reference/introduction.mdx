Welcome to the Logx Network API documentation. This guide provides the information you need to interact with the Logx Network API.

## Base Endpoint

All requests to the Logx Network API are made to the following base endpoint:

`https://testnet-api.logx.network`

## Authentication

The Logx Network API uses different authentication methods depending on the endpoint. Here's a breakdown of the authentication requirements:

-   **API Key and Secret**: Some endpoints require authentication using `logx-key` and `logx-secret`. You can obtain these credentials by using the `/auth` API endpoint.

-   **Signature**: Some endpoints require a combination of `logx-key`, `logx-secret`, and a signature to verify the request.

-   **No Authentication**: Certain endpoints are publicly accessible and do not require any authentication.

For detailed information on how to authenticate API requests, please refer to the [Authentication Documentation](/user-flows/authentication).
