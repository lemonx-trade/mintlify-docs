## Overview

Perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the price movement of an asset without the constraints of an expiration date. On the **LogX Network**, perpetual futures are entirely on-chain, leveraging blockchain technology to ensure transparency, security, and efficiency in trading.

## How Perpetual Futures Work

Unlike traditional futures contracts, perpetual futures do not have a predetermined settlement date. This absence of expiration means traders can maintain their positions indefinitely, giving them the flexibility to strategize over both short and long-term horizons.

When a trader enters a perpetual futures contract on the logX network, they agree to exchange the difference in the price of an asset from the time the contract is opened until it is closed. This difference is settled in cash, providing a seamless and straightforward mechanism for profit and loss realization.

### Leverage

One of the defining features of perpetual futures is the ability to trade with leverage. Leverage amplifies the exposure to price movements, allowing traders to control larger positions with a smaller amount of capital. However, this also increases the risk, as losses can exceed the initial investment if the market moves unfavorably.

### No Expiry, Continuous Settlement

The lack of an expiration date means that perpetual futures can be held for as long as the trader wishes. However, it is crucial to actively manage these positions, as the continuous nature of the contract requires ongoing attention to market conditions and potential changes in asset prices.

This structure allows for a more dynamic trading environment, where positions can be adjusted in real-time based on market fluctuations, without the pressure of rolling over contracts as seen in traditional futures markets.

## Key Benefits

Perpetual futures on the logX network offer a powerful tool for traders looking to engage in leveraged trading without the constraints of fixed contract durations. The on-chain nature of these contracts ensures a high level of security and transparency, while the flexibility to hold positions indefinitely provides traders with a versatile instrument to navigate various market conditions. Whether you're hedging existing positions or speculating on price movements, perpetual futures on logX network present a sophisticated avenue for managing risk and maximizing potential returns.
