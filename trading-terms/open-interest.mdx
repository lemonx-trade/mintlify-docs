Open Interest (OI) is an important metric on the LogX Network that helps gauge the overall activity and liquidity in the market. It reflects the level of participation from traders and provides insights into the health of the market.

## **Understanding Open Interest (OI)**

### **What is Open Interest?**

Open Interest (OI) is the total value of perpetual contracts on the LogX Network that are currently active and have not yet been closed or settled. It shows how much money is currently tied up in these open positions.

### **How is OI Calculated?**

On the LogX Network, OI is calculated based on the deposits made by solvers (the entities facilitating trades) and their ability to support trading activity. OI is often shown as a ratio between the current OI and the available OI.

**Formula:**

```plaintext
OI Ratio = Current OI / Available OI
```

When the current OI gets close to the available OI, it means the market is very active. However, this also means that starting new trades might be harder until some existing trades are closed.
